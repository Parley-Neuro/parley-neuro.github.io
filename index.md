## The Hidden Epidemic of Central Hearing Loss

When your mother warned about listening to loud music, she was only half right. Central hearing loss isn't about ear damage - it's a neurological condition that affects millions, including:

- 50% of people over 65
- Individuals with autism spectrum disorders
- People struggling with "cocktail party syndrome"

Despite having healthy ears, patients struggle to hear in crowded spaces because their brains can't process and separate sounds effectively. Traditional hearing aids don't address this neural processing challenge.

## Our Solution

Building on a decade of NIH-funded research at the [Klug Lab](https://kluglab.org), Parley Neurotech has developed:

1. A non-invasive diagnostic tool to accurately identify central hearing loss
2. The first effective treatment combining:
   - One month of safe, FDA-approved medication
   - Engineered sound therapy

## Market Opportunity

- $40B serviceable addressable US market based on hearing aid adoption rates
- First-mover advantage in an untapped market
- Patent-pending technology
- Proven results in animal trials
- Peer-reviewed research foundation
